VLMa (VideoLAN Manager)
=======================

VLMa is an application which aims at providing an easy way to manage
several servers running VLC at the same time. It consists of a daemon
responsible for assigning orders to available servers and a web
interface to manage configuration.

VLMa is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public Licence
(GPL) version 2 or any later version. See COPYING.

A typical use case is the streaming of satellite channels over a
multicast network. However, VLMa can also help you stream files or TNT
channels over a network that doesn't support multicast. For more
