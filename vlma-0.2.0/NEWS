Changes between 0.1 and 0.2.0
=============================

Important notes:
----------------
 * The daemon and web UI are now provided in a single archive file,
   which includes wrapper scripts to start and shutdown VLMa.
 * data.xml format has been updated, a file working with VLMa 0.1 will
   not work with later versions.
 * Many things are now configurable (telnet port, password, default SAP
   group, etc.), they are saved in the config.properties file.

Changes:
--------
Daemon:
 * A shutdown hook has been added to make sure that everything is
   stopped properly (graph updates, etc.).

Streaming:
 * HTTP streaming support.
 * Podcast announcement support.
 * VLMa can now use other streams as input.
 * Ability to choose the encapsulation format.
 * There can be more than one files channel per server.

 * Commands which are sent to the telnet interface of VLC instances can
   be monitored online.
 * Configuration is manageable online.
 * The web interface now can reconnect to the RMI registry if the daemon
   becomes unavailable or is restarted. There is no more need to reload
   the webapp.

   transparent.
